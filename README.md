# Template-Matching
Created algorithm in C to detect and highlight best image match with template (2 px accuracy) using pixelwise brute force.  The algorithm is optimized by 16x to take less than 5 seconds per image-template pair on i7 processor by down-sampling.
To run the program:
1. Execute make file
2. template <source image> <template image to match with>
 
  OR

1. Just run existing template.exe with arguments as:
template <source image> <template image to match with>
